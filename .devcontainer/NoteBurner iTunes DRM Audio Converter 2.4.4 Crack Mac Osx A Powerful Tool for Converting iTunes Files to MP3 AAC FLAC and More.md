Why do you need to convert iTunes audio files to MP3 or AAC format? The reason is that iTunes audio files are protected by DRM (Digital Rights Management), which prevents you from playing them on unauthorized devices or platforms. For example, you cannot play Apple Music songs on an Android phone or a Windows PC, or burn them to a CD. You also cannot edit or share the iTunes audiobooks or M4P music files.
